### DONT MAKE IT A SCHOOL REPORT, USE IT AS SOMEONE PAID YOU TO EXPLORE THE DATA###
# Chicago-Crime-data
 

I always see on the news how cities can be extremely dangerous places to live. I decided to see if that was really true and I picked Chicago for my data set. What makes this project stand out from my other projects is where I first used Tableau. I learned after using Tableau, while there is crime all over, it is usually bad around only a few areas of Chicago.
